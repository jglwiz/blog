### About this blog

As you can see, English is not my native language. You may find some grammar errors if so, please contact me.

I like to write in English, it's a good way to improve my skills. If you want the Portuguese version of my writings you may want to take a look at [Buteco Open Source](http://blog.butecopensource.org/author/alexandrevicenzi/) or at [FilipeFlop](http://blog.filipeflop.com/author/alexandre-vicenzi/).

The goal of this blog is to talk about things I'm working on.
